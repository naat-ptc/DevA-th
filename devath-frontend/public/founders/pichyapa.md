DevA started off as a group of university students who want to develop themselves. Now,

we are innovators. Together, we learn, grow, and share common visions where we want to innovate

and change the world. At DevA, we value open communications and personal values. We collaborate

while developing ourselves to be who we want to be, to create a world we want to live in.

I would like to study at what I like and what I interested in, working with DevA give me the opportunity to explore, also we have been doing innovation challenges that let me have time to develop myself more about my interest at machine learning and AI, especially the computer vision. In the future, I would like to study more and do more project that could enhance chance for people in society to reach the technology, leading into equally society for everyone.
